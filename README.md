# WeatherAlert

A local university is designing a system for weather-alert notification that allows students, faculty, and staff to receive notifications of class cancellations (due to weather) via e-mail, voice call, or SMS text messages. Other methods of notification may be added in the future. The system is based on the weather data decision engine that interfaces with several weather-related data sources, fuses the information, and automatically decides whether class cancellations are in effect. The university is interested in integrating the existing communication services (i.e., e-mail, SMS, and voice) with the decision engine so that these services can be triggered to initiate notification via their respective communication types. 

The design is flexible so that other types of communication mechanisms can be added to the system in the future.

This program is designed using Python Programming Language. It uses a Observer Design Pattern to implement WeatherAlert.
